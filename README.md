# Ratcycle
Serious Game that teaches children about recycling (Uses Monogame)

# Setup instructions

## Xamarin

1. Create a new solution (Monogame MonoMac), name it Ratcycle
2. Within the project folder go to the solution folder `Ratcycle/Ratcycle`
3. Delete `Game1.cs`
4. clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/evil-moustachio/Ratcycle.git Common`
5. Add the `Common` folder to the project in Xamarin

## Visual Studio
We're working on specific instructions, but it's the same idea as Xamarin.
